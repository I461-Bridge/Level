## About

**Problem Statement:** 

For an experienced Dungeons and Dragons player, managing a character is easy, but for players new to the game it can be a daunting mess of numbers, dice, and complicated rules. Keeping track of the **many different character stats** can be overwhelming - all of which frequently change throughout the course of a Dungeons and Dragons campaign. In addition, there are so **many different story decisions** that are made by players throughout a Dungeons and Dragons campaign that have to be kept track of.

One way to manage these decisions and character stats that many Dungeons and Dragons players utilize by using the Player’s Handbook, Monster Manual, and Dungeon Master’s Guide. In order to create a character or simply trying out the game, players are already faced with a **cost of $30 or more**. 

While these books do a wonderful job of easing players into the game mechanics, providing context on story decisions and guiding them through the process of creating one’s first character, they are not an **accessible resource** to everyone because of the cost and the size of the books, which may be intimidating and inefficient to novice players.

Although there are apps that allow players to store character sheets, which arguably automates the leveling up process, these apps do not provide **sufficient nor relevant information** to help them with story decisions. Because these apps require you to use the entire character sheet, they are **inflexible** for different play styles. Players are forced to copy over information that may already be tracked in other campaign management tools like [Roll20](https://roll20.net/), which results in very inefficient gameplays.

Through our design, we hope to **automate** the information management and consumption process for Dungeons and Dragons while allowing players to have more **choice** in the information that they want to keep track of, which has the **flexibility** to accommodate the use of other Dungeons and Dragons campaign management tools.
